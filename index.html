            <h1 class="display-1">JJ Park</h1>
            <p><em>by William McCartney</em></p>

            <p class="lead">I live near a park titled John J. Carty Park, or more commonly known simply as J.J. Park. I don't have that big of a connection to it, but when I wanted to go to a park I would go to that one. It’s where all of my friends would go after school to do practically anything. The few times I was invited by my friends was at J.J. Park I noticed it is particularly small. The reason is simply because of its inability to be any bigger, it is sandwiched between two streets, one being a highway to a bridge. Despite this, it’s filled with small versions of its larger siblings, such as playgrounds, benches, swings and even a tree in the middle.
            </p>
            <p>
            Here’s why I’m focusing on small size. I was born in Queens, however I lived for nearly a decade in North Carolina. We moved back here because My mother got a new job offer and I could get a better chance at a better career by going to New York schools.
            </p>
            <p>
            In North Carolina there was a ton of space. It is for the most part a very suburban landscape. I lived in an area that was a massive project to make suburban neighborhoods a lot more industrial and urban. There was a lot of room for lots of things, huge sections of woods and creeks could be left untouched because of the abundance of space.
            </p>
            <p>
            New York, however, is an island. It is a tiny 23 square miles. There is nothing in this city that has been reserved. Central Park was artificially made. It’s because everything in New York's space has to be used, in order to support its booming economy due to all of the imports and trade it’s getting. Even that isn’t enough most of the time, sometimes what we can only do to expand is go up. We have the tallest skyscrapers in the Western Hemisphere topped only by Dubai and their massive oil transport business.
            </p>
            <p>
            This has lead to cultures taking a strange approach in the city. After all, there is a massive population here. There are nearly twelve million humans living here. There is going to be a large variety of cultures in New York because of that. This sum of all cultures mixed together into a small space can be seen in New York. While all of these cultures exist everywhere in America, New York is unique because it has been gathering all of these ways of living into the tiny island it is. This is a interesting experience as then you can come across a Mexican mom and pop shop on one side of a street and then a islamic deli on the other. It also makes mini pockets of cultures that mimic the origin, like China Town. I specifically live near the border of a large muslim pocket community in New York.
            </p>
            <p>
            That’s what my park is. A prime example of New York. All of the different items and things all miniaturized and squeezed into one small spot. I don’t have any special connection to it, I don’t have any connection to places in general here. However the park is the park that I would go to if I ever wanted to go to a park, so I would begin to remember the park and compare it to other parks I’d come by. Even in this dense city, it could spare space for parks that are sizably larger than J.J. Park, like how in other parts of the suburbs can. But when there are restrictions that limit the size of the land, everything isn’t going to be there, but definitely a little bit of it.</p>
